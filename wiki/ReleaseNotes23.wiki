= Release Notes for REST Assured 2.3.0 =

== Highlights ==
  * Improved [Usage#SSL_Config SSL configuration]. Fixed several regression bugs and allows for defining a trust store and a `SSLSocketFactory`. 
  * It's now much easier to connect to sites with invalid SSL certificates. All you have to do is to use the `relaxedHTTPSValidation` method. For example:
  {{{
given().relaxedHTTPSValidation().when().get("https://some_server.com"). .. 
  }}}
  You can also define this statically for all requests:
  {{{
RestAssured.useRelaxedHTTPSValidation();
  }}}
  or in a [Usage#Specification_Re-use request specification].
  * Added support for authentication to [Usage#Spring_Mock_Mvc_Module RestAssuredMockMvc]. You can now do e.g. 
  {{{
given().auth().principal(..). ..
  }}}
  Some authentication methods require Spring Security to be on the classpath (optional). It's also possible to defined authentication statically:
  {{{
RestAssuredMockMvc.authentication = principal("username", "password");
  }}}
  where the `principal` method is statically imported from [http://rest-assured.googlecode.com/svn/tags/2.3.0/apidocs/com/jayway/restassured/module/mockmvc/RestAssuredMockMvc.html RestAssuredMockMvc]. It's also possible to define an authentication scheme in a request builder:
  {{{
 MockMvcRequestSpecification spec = new MockMvcRequestSpecBuilder.setAuth(principal("username", "password")).build();
  }}}
  * Added support for using parts of the response when verifying another part of the response. For example consider the following JSON document returned from service x:
  {{{
{ "userId" : "some-id", "href" : "http://localhost:8080/some-id" }
  }}}
  You may notice that the "href" attribute ends with the value of the "userId" attribute. If we want to verify this we can implement a `com.jayway.restassured.matcher.ResponseAwareMatcher` and use it like this:
  {{{
get("/x").then().body("href", new ResponseAwareMatcher<Response>() {
                                  public Matcher<?> matcher(Response response) {
                                          return equalTo("http://localhost:8080/" + response.path("userId"));
                                  }
                       });
  }}}
  There are some predefined matchers that you can use defined in the `com.jayway.restassured.matcher.RestAssuredMatchers` (or `com.jayway.restassured.module.mockmvc.matcher.RestAssuredMockMvcMatchers` if using the spring-mock-mvc module). For example:
  {{{
get("/x").then().body("href", endsWithPath("userId"));
  }}}
  `RestAssuredMatchers` can also be composed, either with another `RestAssuredMatcher` or with a Hamcrest Matcher. For example:
  {{{
get("/x").then().body("href", endsWithPath("userId").and(startsWith("http:/localhost:8080/")));
  }}}

==Non-backward compatible changes ==
  * The json-path module accidentally depended on faster-jackson, jackson, gson and simple-json and brought then in as transitive dependencies. This has now been resolved which means that these dependencies are optional as intended (issue 297).
  * Statically defined configuration (such as `RestAssured.config = ..`) is now automatically applied to RequestSpecBuilders in both RestAssured and RestAssuredMockMvc. To revert to previous behavior you can do
  {{{
new RequestSpecBuilder.config(newConfig()). .
  }}}

= Release Notes for REST Assured 2.3.0 =

== Highlights ==
  * Improved [Usage#SSL_Config SSL configuration]. Fixed several regression bugs and allows for defining a trust store and a `SSLSocketFactory`. 
  * It's now much easier to connect to sites with invalid SSL certificates. All you have to do is to use the `relaxedHTTPSValidation` method. For example:
  {{{
given().relaxedHTTPSValidation().when().get("https://some_server.com"). .. 
  }}}
  You can also define this statically for all requests:
  {{{
RestAssured.useRelaxedHTTPSValidation();
  }}}
  or in a [Usage#Specification_Re-use request specification].

==Non-backward compatible changes ==
  * The json-path module accidentally depended on faster-jackson, jackson, gson and simple-json and brought then in as transitive dependencies. This has now been resolved which means that these dependencies are optional as intended (issue 297).
  * Statically defined configuration (such as `RestAssured.config = ..`) is now automatically applied to RequestSpecBuilders in both RestAssured and RestAssuredMockMvc. To revert to previous behavior you can do
  {{{
new RequestSpecBuilder.config(newConfig()). .
  }}}

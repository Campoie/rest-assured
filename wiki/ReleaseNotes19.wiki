= Release Notes for REST Assured 1.9.0 =

== Highlights ==
  * It's now possible to configure content decoders. Before GZIP and DEFLATE were always activated and there was no way to disable them. For example to remove GZIP but retain DEFLATE you can do the following:
   {{{
given().config(newConfig().decoderConfig(decoderConfig().contentDecoders(DEFLATE))). ..
   }}}
  * Added method `htmlPath` to REST Assured Response which allows you to easily get values from an HTML page:
    {{{
String pageTitle = get("/index.html").htmlPath().getString("html.head.title");
    }}}
  * URL encoding (and disabling of URL encoding) has been completely re-written and will now work better
== Non-backward compatible changes ==
  * RestAssuredConfig no longer accepts a JsonPathConfig, it now uses a JsonConfig object instead.
  * Getting cookies as a Map now returns the last value returned instead of the first one if multiple cookies with the same name are sent from the server to comply with the HTTP specification


== Other notable changes ==


== Minor changes ==
  * Fixed issues that made an incorrect port being used under certain conditions

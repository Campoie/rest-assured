= Release Notes for REST Assured 2.0.0 =

== Highlights ==
  * Introducing support for Given-When-Then expressions! This means that assertions can be defined at the end of the expression. For example:
    {{{
get("/x").then().assertThat().body("x.y", equalTo("z"));
    }}}

  or using the parameters etc:
    {{{
given().
        contentType(JSON).
        body(dto).
when().
        post("/myresource").
then().
        statusCode(200).
        header("headerName", not(nullValue())).
        body("x.y", equalTo("y")).
        body("x.z", equalTo("z"));
    }}}

== Other notable changes ==
  * Fixed so that the path method in the Response can be invoked multiple times, for example:
    {{{
Response response = get("/jsonStore");
float minPrice = response.path("store.book.price.min()");
float maxPrice = response.path("store.book.price.max()");
    }}}
  * Added support for performing requests with URI's and URL's, for example:
    {{{
URI myUri = new URI(..)
Response response = get(myUri);
    }}}
  * Added possibility to call request methods without any parameters. This is useful if you want to call the root resource. For example:
    {{{
RestAssured.baseURI = "http://localhost:8080/hello";
String y = get().path("x.y");
    }}}

== Minor changes ==
  * Fixed so that JsonPath and XmlPath and path expressions work after the "prettyPrint" and "print" methods have been called on a Response instance.
  * Fixed several regression bugs introduce with version 1.9.0.

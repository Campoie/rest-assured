= Release Notes for REST Assured 1.8.0 =

== Highlights ==
  * [http://rest-assured.googlecode.com/svn/tags/1.8.0/apidocs/com/jayway/restassured/path/xml/XmlPath.html XmlPath] and [http://rest-assured.googlecode.com/svn/tags/1.8.0/apidocs/com/jayway/restassured/path/json/JsonPath.html JsonPath] have been extracted to their own projects which means that you can use them without depending on REST Assured. See the [GettingStarted getting started] page for more details on how to start using them.
  * Both XmlPath and JsonPath can now be configured independently. For example you can config custom object serializers and charset etc. JsonPath example:

    {{{
    JsonPath jsonPath = new JsonPath(SOME_JSON).using(new JsonPathConfig("UTF-8"));
    }}}

    It's also possible to configure JsonPath and XmlPath statically:

    {{{
    JsonPath.config = new JsonPathConfig("UTF-8");
    }}}

    See [http://rest-assured.googlecode.com/svn/tags/1.8.0/apidocs/com/jayway/restassured/path/json/config/JsonPathConfig.html JsonPathConfig] and [http://rest-assured.googlecode.com/svn/tags/1.8.0/apidocs/com/jayway/restassured/path/xml/config/XmlPathConfig.html XmlPathConfig] for more details.

== Non-backward compatible changes ==
  * Third party dependencies have been updated, download the corresponding distribution zip file from the [http://code.google.com/p/rest-assured/downloads/list download page].
  * `com.jayway.restassured.exception.ParsePathException` was renamed to `com.jayway.restassured.exception.PathException`
  * JsonPath now throws [http://rest-assured.googlecode.com/svn/tags/1.8.0/apidocs/com/jayway/restassured/path/json/exception/JsonPathException.html JsonPathException] instead of Groovy's `JsonException` when parsing invalid JSON documents
  * XmlPath now throws [http://rest-assured.googlecode.com/svn/tags/1.8.0/apidocs/com/jayway/restassured/path/xml/exception/XmlPathException.html XmlPathException] instead of `PathException` when parsing invalid malformed XML documents
  * [http://rest-assured.googlecode.com/svn/tags/1.8.0/apidocs/com/jayway/restassured/mapper/ObjectMapperDeserializationContext.html ObjectMapperDeserializationContext]#getResponse() has been renamed to "getDataToDeserialize()". It no longer returns an instance of `ResponseBodyData`, it now returns an instance of [http://rest-assured.googlecode.com/svn/tags/1.8.0/apidocs/com/jayway/restassured/mapper/DataToDeserialize.html DataToDeserialize].

== Other notable changes ==
  * Added getPath method to [http://rest-assured.googlecode.com/svn/tags/1.8.0/apidocs/com/jayway/restassured/path/xml/element/Node.html Node] and [http://rest-assured.googlecode.com/svn/tags/1.8.0/apidocs/com/jayway/restassured/path/xml/element/NodeChildren.html NodeChildren] elements in XmlPath which allows you get a subpath using the GPath notation.
  * Improved speed of JsonPath when parsing multiple values
  * Upgraded to Groovy 2.1.2

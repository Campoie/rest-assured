= Release Notes for REST Assured 1.8.0 =

== Highlights ==
  * [http://rest-assured.googlecode.com/svn/tags/1.8.0/apidocs/com/jayway/restassured/path/xml/XmlPath.html XmlPath] and [http://rest-assured.googlecode.com/svn/tags/1.8.0/apidocs/com/jayway/restassured/path/json/JsonPath.html JsonPath] have been extracted to their own projects which means that you can use them without depending on REST Assured. See the [GettingStarted getting started] page for more details on how to start using them.
  * Both XmlPath and JsonPath can now be configured independently. For example you can config custom object serializers and charset etc. See [http://rest-assured.googlecode.com/svn/tags/1.8.0/apidocs/com/jayway/restassured/path/json/config/JsonPathConfig.html JsonPathConfig] and http://rest-assured.googlecode.com/svn/tags/1.8.0/apidocs/com/jayway/restassured/path/xml/config/XmlPathConfig.html XmlPathConfig] for more details.

== Non-backward compatible changes ==
  * Third party dependencies have been updated (new versions of http client needed to support the PATCH verb). If you're not using Maven you need replace the [http://rest-assured.googlecode.com/files/rest-assured-1.5-to-1.6.2-dependencies.zip old] ones with the [http://rest-assured.googlecode.com/files/rest-assured-dependencies.zip new] ones in the classpath.
  * The previous release broke downloading of large files (http chunking) to allow for stress testing with REST Assured. This has now been fixed but if you want to do stress testing you need to configure REST Assured to drop connections after each response using the new [http://code.google.com/p/rest-assured/wiki/Usage#Connection_Config connection config].

== Deprecations ==
  * The enums in `com.jayway.restassured.mapper.ObjectMapper` (e.g. `ObjectMapper.GSON`) has been moved to `com.jayway.restassured.mapper.ObjectMapperType`.

== Other notable changes ==
  * Fixed so that it's possible to download large (chunked) files again. This was broken in the last release, 1.6.2. (issue 194).
  * Added a [http://rest-assured.googlecode.com/svn/tags/1.7/apidocs/com/jayway/restassured/config/ConnectionConfig.html ConnectionConfig] object that allows you to modify if REST Assured should drop idle connections after each response. Enable connection dropping if you need to make several small and fast requests (e.g. stress testing).
